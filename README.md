# Forecasting the Risk of Heart Disease

According to the World Health Organization (WHO), cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are responsible for 17.9 million deaths annually. Numerous factors, including unhealthy diets, physical inactivity, and mental illnesses, can increase an individual's risk of developing CVD. Early identification of these risk factors is crucial for preventing many premature deaths.

In this project, I will utilize a [Kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/heart-failure-prediction) and develop a K-Nearest Neighbors classifier to accurately predict the likelihood of a patient developing heart disease in the future.
